### About Me
My name is Herbert Hall and I am an Economics and Mathematical Sciences student at Georgia Southern University. I would describe myself in three words:
1. Optimistic
2. Reflective
3. Unfinished

In everything I do, I aim to remain optimistic for the things to come, reflective on things of the past, and aware that my present self is an unfinished work. 

### My Interests

### About My Content
The posts I make are a collection of thought experiments and problem solving approaches about my fields of interest. Ranging from overviews of prominent academic papers to conducting data analyses and tests, this blog is meant to present ideas that can bring insight as I learn about these fields. These posts are my public thought record for learning and not necessarily for ground-breaking results.

Because of this, my posts may contain misinterpretations or errors about the topics I choose to write about. I appreciate anyone who reaches out to me about any errors they may find. I am open to discuss thoughts about them as they come about.
